# AI Desktop Assistant

A simple and interactive desktop-based AI Assistant built in **Python**, using **Tkinter** for GUI and **pyttsx3** for Text-to-Speech (TTS).  
Type commands or chat in a friendly UI, and the assistant can speak responses, open websites or applications, tell the date/time — all from your desktop.
